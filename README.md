Pencil Durability Kata  
  
To run all unit tests at once, download repo and in either the "kata-pencil-durability" or "tests" directory, run `python -m unittest discover .` on the command line/terminal  

Or, `cd tests` and run each individual test file if you wish using `python testX.py` where X is the rest of the filename (Editing, Erase, EraserDegradation, PointDegradation, Sharpening, or Writing)  

You can also run a quick simulation that gives an overview of a pencil's features and diagnostics about that pencil by running `python simulation.py`

NOTE: Was written and tested in/for Python 3.7.3, if encountering difficulty please make sure you are on one of the newer versions of Python although 2.7 should theoretically work
